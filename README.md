# Seeder

It provides simple tooling and a convention for creating single page apps, so you can focus on the cool thing you want to build!
It will be a better alternative to [seed-quickstart-webpack](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart-webpack).
Everything will be written in Rust.

**WIP** - [support me](https://github.com/sponsors/MartinKavik) to make the development faster ; I'll write announcement on Seed forum and chat once it's ready for beta testing (links on [seed-rs.org](https://seed-rs.org/)).
