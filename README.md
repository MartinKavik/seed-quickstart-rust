# Seeder

---

### NOTE: 
New Seed/WASM bundlers have been developed before I was able to really start to work on this project so I recommend to use them instead:
- [Trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk) - WASM web application bundler for Rust.
- [Web Bundler](https://github.com/panoptix-za/web-bundler) - Bundles a Seed SPA for publishing.

(They are also listed on the [Seed Awesome list](https://github.com/seed-rs/awesome-seed-rs#bundlers))

It provides simple tooling and a convention for creating single page apps, so you can focus on the cool thing you want to build!
It will be a better alternative to [seed-quickstart-webpack](https://github.com/seed-rs/seed-quickstart-webpack).
Everything will be written in Rust.

**WIP** - [support me](https://github.com/sponsors/MartinKavik) to make the development faster ; I'll write announcement on Seed forum and chat once it's ready for beta testing (links on [seed-rs.org](https://seed-rs.org/)).
